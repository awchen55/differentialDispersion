```

## To-Do Items
1. Look at overlap of significant genes across replicates compared replicates compared to overlap expected due to chance
2. Test regressing out % of zeros, % mitochondrial reads in normalization 
3. Quantify effect size of dispersion (histogram of genes with high dispersion)
4. Organize workflowr and add more description on data, procedure, papers, etc.
5. Look into estimating dispersion using NB distribution
