# Objective
To develop a way to quantifiably measure gene dispersion and compare levels of dispersion across different contexts such as species, cell types, and individuals. 

# Simulations

> [Poisson and Negative Binomial Analysis](simulation_null_analysis.html)

# Applications

## Human-Chimp Hybrid Data Set

> Click on this [link](differential_dispersion_hybrid_line_cpm_analysis.html) to find initial dispersion comparisons using the LOWESS method.
