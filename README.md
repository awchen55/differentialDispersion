# differentialDispersion

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop a way to compare variance across different contexts such as species, cell types, and individuals. A property of single cell data is the direct mean-variance relationship in gene expression. Thus, a procedure to capture variance independent of the mean may be biologically informative. Specifically, we aim to measure dispersion as a quantifiable metric that drives these differences in variance. Technically, dispersion may be measured as the mean-independent variance. Theoretically, dispersion is the biological variation associated with transcriptional and translational events.
